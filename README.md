# Data Set and Code Repository for the Article, "Distributed Proprioception of 3D Configuration in Soft Sensorized Robots via Deep Learning"

In this SoftArm repository of SensoSoRo, we provide the data sets and relevant MATLAB scripts used in the journal article 

> "R L Truby, C Della Sandina, Daniela Rus. Distributed Proprioception of 3D Configuration in Soft Sensorized Robots via Deep Learning. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2020." 

Data sets include the raw training and validation sets used in this publication and the training scripts used as well. We intend to update this repository over time as necessary and/or upon reasonable request.

## Getting Started and Navigation

We use MATLAB 2019 and MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox for all analysis, data processing, and training of neural networks. Data sets are currently provided as .mat files, and training scripts are provided as .m files.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
